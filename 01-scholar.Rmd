## Connecting to Scholar {#connecting-to-scholar}

There are a variety of ways to connect to Scholar; however, the primary method (and maybe the only method) we will use this semester is [RStudio Server Pro](#rstudio-server-pro). To see how one may approach solving a project this semester, watch Dr. Ward connect to RStudio Server Pro and demonstrate how to compile a project [here](#templates).

### RStudio Server Pro {#rstudio-server-pro}

**[Getting started with Scholar and RStudio: part I](https://cdnapisec.kaltura.com/p/983291/sp/98329100/embedIframeJs/uiconf_id/29134031/partner_id/983291?iframeembed=true&playerId=kaltura_player&entry_id=1_vw9pj4ip&flashvars[streamerType]=auto&amp;flashvars[localizationCode]=en&amp;flashvars[leadWithHTML5]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.position]=left&amp;flashvars[sideBarContainer.clickToClose]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[chapters.layout]=vertical&amp;flashvars[chapters.thumbnailRotator]=false&amp;flashvars[streamSelector.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[EmbedPlayer.SpinnerTarget]=videoHolder&amp;flashvars[dualScreen.plugin]=true&amp;flashvars[Kaltura.addCrossoriginToIframe]=true&amp;&wid=1_0gmky2np)**
